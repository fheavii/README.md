This project presents an Excel-based dashboard analyzing daily coffee shop sales in Cape Town.The dataset records individual transactions, including timestamps, payment methods (cash or card), product names, and revenue per sale.The dashboard aims to uncover customer behavior patterns, peak business hours, and product performance, providing valuable insights for operational and marketing decisions.Through this project, I practiced transforming raw transaction data into a clean, interactive Excel dashboard using pivot tables, charts, and data-driven KPIs.
